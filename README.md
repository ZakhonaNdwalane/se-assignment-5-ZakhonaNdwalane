 Questions:

1. Installation of VS Code:
   - Describe the steps to download and install Visual Studio Code on Windows 11 operating system. Include any prerequisites that might be needed.

 Go to the official website on Google and navigate to VS code Download 
•	Click on the ‘Download’ button for windows. This should start the download of the latest installer immediately.
•	Once the download is complete, locate the downloaded file, normally under Downloads.  unless located elsewhere by the downloader and the file name will look something like this ‘VSCodeSetup-x64-1.x.x.exe’.
•	Double-click the installer and run it. There ,might be user account prompts asking for permission to make changes to your device. Click ‘Yes’ to continue. 
•	Accept the licence agreement: read through the agreement, check the box ‘I accept the agreement’. Click ‘Next’.
•	Select the installation location, by default VS Code will be installed in ‘C:\Program Files\Microsoft VS Code’. However, the installation can be in another location, click ‘browse’ and choose the preferred location. Click ‘Next’. 
•	Check the Box for ‘create a desktop icon’ if you want a shortcut on your desktop. Click ‘Next’. 
•	Once the installation is complete, it will appear on the screen and check the box launch visual studio code, click ‘Finish’. 
•	Initial Setup, you can skip the welcome section and go through the setup to configure  settings like theme, keybindings and extensions.  
•	Install Extensions: To extend the functionality of VS code, click on the Extensions icon extensions icon on the sidebar, Search for the extensions you need (e.g., Python, C++, Git, etc.) and click ‘install’.

9. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?

Step 1: Install Necessary Extensions
•	Ensure you have the appropriate language extension installed for your project. For example:
o	Python: Install the Python extension by Microsoft.
o	JavaScript/Node.js: Built-in support, but you can install additional extensions if needed.
o	C/C++: Install the C/C++ extension by Microsoft.
Step 2: Open or Create Your Project
•	Open VS Code and open the folder containing your project files.
o	Go to File > Open Folder and select your project directory.
o	Alternatively, use the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P) and type Open Folder.
Step 3: Write or Open Your Code
•	Write a simple program or open an existing one.
o	Example for Python:
python
Copy code
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = add(2, 3)
    print("The result is", result)
o	Example for JavaScript/Node.js:
javascript
Copy code
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

console.log("The result is", add(2, 3));
Step 4: Configure the Debugger
•	Create a launch configuration file (launch.json):
o	Open the Debug view by clicking the Debug icon in the Activity Bar or pressing Ctrl+Shift+D (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+D (macOS).
o	Click on the gear icon at the top of the Debug panel and select your environment (e.g., Python, Node.js).
o	A launch.json file will be created in the .vscode folder. It should contain default configurations that you can modify.
o	Example for Python:
json
Copy code
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [

Step 5: Set Breakpoints
•	Click in the gutter (left margin) next to the line number where you want to set a breakpoint.
•	A red dot will appear, indicating that a breakpoint has been set.
Step 6: Start Debugging
•	Press F5 to start the debugger.
•	Alternatively, go to the Debug view and click the green play button at the top.
•	The debugger will start and stop at the breakpoints you've set.
Key Debugging Features in VS Code
1.	Breakpoints:
o	Set breakpoints by clicking in the gutter next to the line number.
o	Conditional breakpoints can be set by right-clicking on a breakpoint and selecting "Edit Breakpoint".
2.	Watch Variables:
o	In the Debug view, you can add variables to the Watch panel to monitor their values during execution.
o	Right-click in the Watch panel and select "Add Expression".
3.	Call Stack:
o	View the call stack to see the sequence of function calls that led to the current point of execution.
o	The Call Stack panel in the Debug view shows this information.
4.	Step In/Out/Over:
o	Use the step controls to navigate through your code:
	Step Over (F10): Execute the next line, but don't step into functions.
	Step Into (F11): Step into the next function call.
	Step Out (Shift+F11): Step out of the current function.
5.	Variables Pane:
o	The Variables pane in the Debug view shows the current values of variables in the local, global, and closure scopes.
6.	Debug Console:
o	Use the Debug Console to evaluate expressions and execute commands in the context of the current debugging session.
o	Access it by clicking on the Debug Console tab in the Debug view.
7.	Exception Handling:
o	Configure how exceptions are handled during debugging.
Click the gear icon in the Breakpoints section of the Debug view and configure the "Exceptions" settings.

10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.


VS Code has built-in support for Git, which allows users to perform version control tasks directly within the editor. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to integrate Git with VS Code, initialize a repository, make commits, and push changes to GitHub.
Step 1: Install Git
•	Ensure Git is installed on your system.
o	Download and install Git from git-scm.com.
Step 2: Configure Git
•	Open a terminal in VS Code (Ctrl+ (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+ (macOS)).
•	Configure your Git username and email if you haven't already:

Copy code
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
Step 3: Initialize a Git Repository
1.	Open your project folder in VS Code.
o	Go to File > Open Folder and select your project directory.
2.	Initialize the repository:
o	Open the Source Control view by clicking the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar on the left side of the screen or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+G (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+G (macOS).
o	Click the Initialize Repository button.
o	Alternatively, open the terminal and run:

Copy code
git init
Step 4: Stage and Commit Changes
1.	Stage changes:
o	In the Source Control view, you'll see a list of changes under Changes.
o	Hover over the files you want to stage and click the + icon next to each file, or click the + icon next to Changes to stage all changes.
o	Alternatively, you can stage changes using the terminal:

Copy code
git add <filename>
or to stage all changes:

Copy code
git add .
2.	Commit changes:
o	In the Source Control view, type a commit message in the message box at the top.
o	Click the ✓ (check mark) icon to commit the staged changes.
o	Alternatively, use the terminal:

Copy code
git commit -m "Your commit message"
Step 5: Connect to GitHub
1.	Create a new repository on GitHub:
o	Go to GitHub and create a new repository.
2.	Add the remote repository:
o	Copy the repository URL from GitHub.
o	In VS Code, open the terminal and run:
Copy code
git remote add origin <repository-url>
o	Verify the remote URL:

Copy code
git remote -v
Step 6: Push Changes to GitHub
•	Push your commits to the GitHub repository:
Copy code
git push -u origin master
•	After the initial push, you can use:

Copy code
git push
Key Git Features in VS Code
1.	Source Control View:
o	Accessed via the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar.
o	Shows changes, staged files, and commit history.
o	Allows for easy staging, committing, and viewing diffs.
2.	Branch Management:
o	Create, switch, and manage branches directly from the Source Control view or Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P).
o	Common commands include Git: Create Branch, Git: Checkout, and Git: Merge Branch.
3.	GitLens Extension:
o	An extension that enhances Git capabilities within VS Code.
o	Provides rich inline blame information, commit history, and more.
4.	Diff and Merge Tools:
o	View and resolve merge conflicts using the built-in diff and merge tools.
o	Diff files by selecting them in the Source Control view and clicking Open Changes.
